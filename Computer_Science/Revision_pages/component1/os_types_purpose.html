 <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub1">Why do we need OSs?</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">An operating system does all of the boring stuff such as managing the memory and processes of a computer and allows you to get the things done, which you need to get done. Essentially, the OS is an abstraction, translating what you want to get done into something the computer can do. The OS coordinates all of the processes on a computer, ensuring that everything gets loaded into memory, gets access to the CPU and runs smoothly. The four main functions of an OS are: 1. Manage the hardware of the system. 2. Manage programs installed and being run. 3. Manage the security of the system. 4. Provide an interface between the user and the computer. The most popular OSs include Android, iOS, MacOS X, Windows, Linux etc.</p>

    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub2">Types of OS</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content"><b>GUI operating system</b> - Uses icons and other visual indicators to allow easier, more natural interaction eg. touch with a touch screen. Examples include most modern operating systems Ubuntu, Windows etc.</p>
  <p class="content"><b>Multi-user operating systems</b> - Most modern operating systems will allow for the creation of multiple user accounts, they allow for more than one person to use the system at a time and share its resources. Files and data tend to be segregated as if each user had their own computer. Common examples include shared hosting servers where many websites are hosted on different accounts on the same server.</p>
   <p class="content"><b>Multi-processing operating system</b> - An operating system capable of using more than one processor, most modern OSs do due to the intensive work we expect our PCs to do.</p>
    <p class="content"><b>Multi-threading operating system</b> - Allows different parts of software to run concurrently, most modern OSs also support this (yes, looking at you with the 10 Billion+ browser tabs)</p>
    <p class="content"><b>Multi-tasking operating system</b> - Allows software processes to run at the same time due to the speed of modern CPUs(billions of cycles per minute remember), which is much faster than any other component. This means the CPU can process for one program, then switch its attention to another while the periferals eg. screen handle the output. All major modern OSs can do this.</p>
    <p class="content"><b>Distributed operating system</b> - Can allow a group of computers to work together on a single task. A distributed OS can control and coordinate them and present them to the user as a single computer. An example may be cloud computing, multiple machines work together but one is only presented with a single interface.</p>
    <p class="content"><b>Embedded operating system</b> - Very specialised. Used for computers which are built into larger systems, and so usually are required to perform only a single function. They tend to be designed with efficiency in mind, to run on RISC SOCs (low power) with little RAM eg. in a vending machine.</p>
    <p class="content"><b>Real-time operating system</b> - Used in safety critical systems to process data in real-time without buffering. They are expected to perform certain tasks within a certain time frame, which is usually given in milliseconds eg. in a driverless car.</p>

    <p class="content">The Kernel is what allows all Operating Systems to function. The kernel is at the very heart of an operating system and allows the software to communicate with the hardware. For example, if the user wanted to turn off the computer, they would tell the OS to do this. This would then get the kernel to interface with the hardware to actually allow this to happen. An example of a kernel is Linux. When using a linux based OS, it is really called GNU Linux. This is because Linux is the kernel and on top of this is built all of the software which the user uses. It deals with input/output requests from software, turning them into requests the CPU can understand, it is also responsible for memory, periferals, everything!</p>
