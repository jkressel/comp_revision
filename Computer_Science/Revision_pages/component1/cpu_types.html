 <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub1">RISC CPUs</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) CPUs are commonly found on SOCs, where simplicity and energy efficiency are valued. RISC CPUs aim to improve performance by reducing the clock-cycles needed for an instruction to execute. RISC CPUs only support a few simple instructions which take a single clock cycle to execute. RISC CPUs also need more registers to store intermediate values. Architectures including ARM make use of RISC.</p>
 <p class="content">For: <br>RISC CPUs are great for simple instructions and also use much less power than CISC CPUs and are therfore good in moblile devices where power is at a premium. Another advantage of the lower power consumption is that less heat is produced, which means that no additional cooling is needed. RISC CPUs are also significantly smaller and cheaper than CISC CPUs, another factor which makes them great for mobile devices.</p>

     <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub2">CISC CPUs</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer) CPUs support many complicated instructions which take longer to execute, but can be faster in more powerful apps where the overall number of separate commands can be reduced. On the whole, CISC CPUs tend to be slower than RISC CPUs but because they support more instructions, they are easier to program.</p>
 <p class="content">For: <br>CISC CPUs are much better for complex tasks, because they support a much larger set of instructions and can run a much higher clock speeds.</p>
