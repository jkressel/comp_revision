 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">This BIOS is responsible for booting up the computer. It is normally stored on a BIOS chip on the motherboard. This chip contains non-volatile memory: either ROM in older systems, or Flash memory in newer ones. It contains the most basic hardware settings and instructions needed to begin booting. Within the BIOS, there are settings for the hardware. Such as hard disk details, memory capacity, memory timing information, optical drive details. The boot order can also be set that tells the BIOS which drive to look to, for the operating system.The BIOS will check that the computer is functional, memory is installed and accessible and the processor is working. This is called the power-on-self-test (POST). Once it has done this, it can use a boot loader program to loaded the operating systemâ€™s kernel into memory. The BIOS is usually stored in flash memory to enable the changing of settings.</p>
