 <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub1">Multi-core and Parallel processing</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">A CPU can have multiple cores, which are simply CPUs which communicate with each other. A developer can make use of extra cores in order to run some intensive operations using multiple cores at once, thus potentially improving performance. However, writing apps to take advantage of multiple cores is very complex, and may even result in worse performance. If software is not optimised to take advantage of a multi-core CPU, then there is no speed advantage over a single-core CPU.</p>

    </div>
    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub2">Clock-speed</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">A CPU's clock is what syncronises all operations in a CPU. The higher the clock-speed of a CPU, the more operations the CPU will carry out per second. For example, a 3GHz CPU will perform 3 billion cycles per second. However, the higher the clock-speed of a CPU, the more heat is generated. It is therefore inadvisable to overclock a CPU because this may shorten its life, and may result in corrupted data because the normal speed at which data is handled may not be able to keep up with the speed of the CPU.</p>

    </div>
    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub3">Cache</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">The size and amount of Cache available to the CPU will have a great impact on the performance of a CPU. The more fast cache which is available, the higher the chance that a piece of data or instruction will be found in the cache (cache hit).</p>

    </div>
    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub4">Pipelining</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">Processor pipelining can help to improve the performance of a CPU because it can help to reduce to time a CPU sits idle, for example, waiting for the next instruction to arrive. Pipelining means that more things can be done at once, like fetching the next instruction while the current one is being executed.</p>

    </div>
    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub5">CPU type</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">The type of CPU used can affect the performance. For example, a RISC CPU for complex apps may be slower than a CISC CPU.</p>
