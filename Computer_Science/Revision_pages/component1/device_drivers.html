 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">A device driver is a piece of software which tells the operating system how to communicate with a device. Device Drivers: Handle the translation of requests between a device and the computer, define where a process must put outgoing data before it can be sent, and where incoming messages will be stored when they are received and wake up the device when it is needed and puts it back to sleep when it is not. Most OSs will come with some generic drivers, and devices which communicate using the same protocol may also use the same driver.</p>
