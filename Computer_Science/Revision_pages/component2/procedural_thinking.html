 <p class="content">The process of thinking through a problem in order to come up with a set of components and steps which will solve a given problem. A procedural programming language is one which will solve a given problem be following a set of instructions or sequences using our old friends, Sequence, Selection and Iteration. Creating procedures by using procedural thinking is benefitial for a number of reasons. Separating a program into its various components and then identifying sub-procedures allows multiple people to be working on different parts of software which will later all work together because the sub-procedures can then all be accessed from the main procedure (in essence, it is like creating functions and classes except, a sub-procedure is a function which does not return anything to the main procedure), errors can also be reduced as repitition is reduced because a procedure can be reused. It also helps with the maintainability of software, because one knows where to look for a certain problem. Finally, it also makes software easier to follow as all functions are procedures and can therefore be logically followed.</p>
 <p class="content">First, start be identifying all of the components of a problem by making a very detailed description of the problem. Next, start to break this description down using <b>AND</b> and <b>OR</b> in order to identify what goes together eg. The computer picks a number AND stores this in a variable. The user is asked for a guess. If the guess is correct, display congrats AND exit. If incorrect repeat until guesses used up OR user quits. One can also make a numbered list from this, as a way of identifying the various procedures eg. (1) Generate number (2) Store in variable etc. From there, each step can be broken down further to make sub-procedures. This type of design is known as top-down design.</p>
 <p class="content">Eventually, one is left with a list of components, notice how the numbered components are an abstraction of the steps that make it up. From this completed list, one can make a flow diagram for each of the components, and then combine them to produce a flow diagram for the whole problem. Also look for sequences of steps which are repeated in a flow diagram, to make them into a named sub-procedures (sub-procedures are simply steps grouped together and given a name eg. print_name and called from the main procedure when needed) in the flow diagram so that it can be referenced time and again. This is a like a function in a flow diagram. Common examples of procedures are native classes and functions built into most programming languages.</p>
