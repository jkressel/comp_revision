 <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub1">Algorithms</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">Algorithms are simply a set of instructions; a way of getting something done. For example, a recipe is an example of an algorithms. In computing, algorithms are created in order to lay down the ideas and logic behind programs, so that they can then be transformed into a piece of software.</p>
  <p class="content">Algorithms contain three basic components: Sequence, Selection and Iteration. Algorithms are very useful in order to take big, complex problems, and break them down into smaller, more managable problems known as subtasks. Basic requirements for a successful algorithm are speed, efficiency and simplicity. Some examples of algorithms include: The Binary Search Algorithm, The Bubble Sort Algorithm and The Merge Sort Algotithm.</p>

    <h2 class="sub_title" id="sub2">Abstraction</h2>
 <div class="subcontent">
 <p class="content">Abstract Thinking (Abstraction) is the process of separating ideas from implementation. For example, in computer science, there are two types of abstraction: Control Abstraction and Data Abstraction.</p>
  <p class="content">Control abstraction is a way of letting a developer focus on their program without getting stuck in machine code.</p>
   <p class="content">Data Abstraction hides how data eg. integers are arranged into bits.</p>
    <p class="content">The basic premise of abstraction is to abstract away various layers so that at a given level, a person can focus on their job. For example, Java is an abstraction; an application written in Java will run everywhere, where Java runs. This is an example of abstraction because the Java VM handles all of the hardware specific drivers etc. meaning that the developer writing Java code can simple focus on their program. Another example is of a writer, who is writing a book; the writer does not know or care how their works are encoded and saved, all the writer cares about is getting the book finished. In this way, technical aspects have been abstracted.</p>
    <p class="content">Steps of abstraction. 1 - Identify the problem. 2 - Define inputs and outputs. 3 - Identify the main components of the problem ie. the main functions which will be required. 4 - Identify reusable code eg. Libraries, OOP etc. 5 - Design the algorithms using Flow Diagrams, Pseudocode etc.</p>
